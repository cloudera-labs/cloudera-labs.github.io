These docs are for Cloudera-Labs on github.io, and supplementary to the official Cloudera documentation at https://docs.cloudera.com/[docs.cloudera.com]

They are intended to provide guidance for the repositories of DevOps tools, Workshops, Demos, and other artefacts published in this Github Organization from time to time.

If you find a mistake in these docs, please raise an https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cloudera-labs.github.io/issues[Issue] on Github, consider using our xref:Contributing[Contribution Guide], or contact a representative of Cloudera for assistance.

They are not intended to be read from front-to-back, instead we have broken up the content into four use-case driven categories:

include::content/orientation/main.adoc[]

include::content/training/main.adoc[]

include::content/guides/main.adoc[]

include::content/references/main.adoc[]
