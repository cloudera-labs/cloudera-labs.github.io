=== Ansible vs cloudera.cluster

.Can't detect the required Python library
This is most commonly caused by having more than the usual number of versions of Python installed.

Very possibly you've ended up with 2.7, 3.6 and 3.8, or something like that, and the library you are looking for is in the wrong version.
Remove extraneous versions, figure out what is installing them and prevent it.

.cannot dnf install with python2
This usually happens when Ansible decides it simply must use /usr/bin/python even though a perfectly good python3 or other is preferred.

Most commonly this is caused by legacy Ansible python version detection where it will *always* use /usr/bin/python if present. This is fixed by adding `ansible_python_interpreter=auto` to all your target hosts in your inventory, such as in the `[deployment:vars]` group.
