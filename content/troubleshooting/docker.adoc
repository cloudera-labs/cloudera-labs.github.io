=== Docker Usage
.docker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?

You need to enable WSL integration in the Docker Desktop settings for Resources > WSL Integration

.SSH_AUTH_SOCK is empty or not set, unable to proceed. Exiting

Run the following command to activate the ssh-agent:
[bash,source]
----
eval `ssh-agent -s`
----

If that command doesn't work, try
[bash,source]
----
eval "$(ssh-agent)"
----

.docker: Error response from daemon: invalid mount config for type "bind": field Source must not be empty.

Probably your SSH_AUTH_SOCK is not populated from the ssh-agent. Same fix as above.

.The path /private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.[some random sting]/Listeners is not shared from the host and is not known to Docker.

You need to add you /private directory to the file sharing in your Docker settings for Resources > File Sharing
